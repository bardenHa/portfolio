## Hello there!

This is my first post on my new blog. I'm just going to use it to write about
whatever I feel like writing about. I'm not sure how often I'll post, but I hope it's at least once a week.
We'll see how that goes.

## The code

This is some example code that I'm going to use to test the syntax highlighting.

```tsx
// src/pages/users/[id].tsx

export const loader = async ({ params: { id } }) => {
  return getUser(id);
};

export default function User() {
  const { data } = useMatch();

  return (
    <div>
      <div>{data.email}</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## The end

This is my first post on my new blog. I'm just going to use it to write about
whatever I feel like writing about. I'm not sure how often I'll post, but I hope it's at least once a week.
We'll see how that goes.
