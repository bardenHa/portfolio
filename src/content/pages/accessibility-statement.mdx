## Introduction

I'm dedicated to making my website available to as many people as I can, regardless of their technology or abilities. And I'm making a concerted effort to improve this website's usability and accessibility while also adhering to many of the established norms and standards.

This website strives to adhere to Level AA of the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (<abbr>WCAG</abbr>) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/). It was created using <abbr title='HyperText Markup Language'>HTML</abbr> and <abbr title='Cascading Style Sheets'>CSS</abbr> code that complies with [<abbr>W3C</abbr> standards](https://www.w3.org/standards/).
