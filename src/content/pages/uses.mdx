## Editor & Terminal

- I wish I were a vim power user but alas I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- I'm using [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) as my shell with [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/).
- I'm using [starship](https://starship.rs/) as my prompt.

## Languages

- Professionally, I'm mostly using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for NodeJS and React development.
- I've been having a lot of fun with [Go](https://go.dev/) lately for some of my personal projects. It's taught me a lot about how to write better code in other languages too.
- Looking to learn some functional programming languages next when I get some time (algebraic data types look amazing). I'm thinking [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) or [F#](https://fsharp.org/).

## Note taking

- My note taking process has been in dire need of a revamp for a while now. I mostly use [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) to store a table of references whenever I find something useful, but I don't have a good system for reviewing/organising them. I'm currently experimenting with the [GTD system](https://gettingthingsdone.com/what-is-gtd/) using Apple's [Reminders](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205890) app to see if it can help me with this.

## Hardware

{/* TODO: Create a blog for PC build and link to it */}

- At home I tend to use my PC for most things, but I also have a MacBook Pro 13" for when I'm on the go.
- I've setup my PC to dual-boot Windows 11 and Linux, but I do most my development on [Fedora Linux](https://fedoraproject.org/). Specs:
  - [AMD Ryzen 9 3900X](https://www.amd.com/en/product/8436)
  - [Corsair 16GB DDR4 RAM 3600Mhz](https://www.corsair.com/uk/en/p/memory/cmw16gx4m2c3600c18/vengeancea-rgb-pro-16gb-2-x-8gb-ddr4-dram-3600mhz-c18-memory-kit-a-black-cmw16gx4m2c3600c18)
  - [NVIDEA GeForce RTX 3070](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/graphics-cards/30-series/rtx-3070-3070ti/)
  - [Samsung 970 EVO Plus 1TB M.2 NVMe SSD](https://www.samsung.com/uk/memory-storage/970-evo-plus-nvme-m2-ssd/MZ-V7S1T0BW/)
  - [ASROCK B550 Steel Legend](https://www.asrock.com/mb/AMD/B550%20Steel%20Legend/index.asp)
  - [Lian Li O11 Dynamic](https://lian-li.com/product/pc-o11-dynamic/)
- Currently using an [iPhone 11](https://www.apple.com/by/iphone-11/specs/) as my phone and have so since 2019. Very pleased with it and the battery life is still going strong.
- Using a [iPad Pro 11" 2nd Gen](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP814) for casual browsing and reading. I bought it on Apple's [refurbished store](https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/refurbished) and it's basically brand new. I'd recommend buying Apple products there if you're looking to save some money and increase reusability.
