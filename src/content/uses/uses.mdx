## Editor & Terminal

- I wish I were a vim power user but alas I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- I'm using [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) as my shell with [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/).
- I'm using [starship](https://starship.rs/) as my prompt.

## Languages

- Professionally, I'm mostly using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for NodeJS and React development.
- I've been having a lot of fun with [Go](https://go.dev/) lately for some of my personal projects. It's taught me a lot about how to write better code in other languages too.

## Apps

- I probably spend too much time on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/).
- I use [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) for note taking and task management.
- I've been toying with implementing a GTD system using Apple's [Reminders](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205890) app.
