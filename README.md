# Personal portfolio website

My [personal portfolio website](https://barden.dev) built with Astro & Solid JS.

I wanted to build a multi-page application (MPA) rather than a single-page application (SPA) since the site doesn't really need much interactivity, and I believe the web will eventually move back to MPAs with the introduction of more native browser APIs such as the [View Transitions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API).

I also wanted to focus on creating an accessible and progressively enhanced website whilst maintaining the developer experience you get with other frameworks, and Astro seemed like a good choice for that.
